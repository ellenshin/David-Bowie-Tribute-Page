      <h3>Here is a timeline of David Bowie's life:</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1947:</strong> David Bowie is born David Robert Hayward-Jones in Brixton, London.</li>
      <li><strong>1962:</strong> Bowie forms his first band, the Konrads.</li>
      <li><strong>1967: </strong>Bowie releases his self-titled debut album, which (along with its first singles), fails to chart upon its initial release.</li>
      <li><strong>1970: </strong>Bowie releases The Man Who Sold the World, his first fully realized album, which transitioned the British folk of his earlier releases into a heavier rock sound, and also saw the singer playing with the androgynous image he'd help pioneer.</li>
      <li><strong>1972: </strong>Bowie releases his landmark record The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, a concept album that saw Bowie embracing a flamboyant glam-rock frontman status and cemented his popularity in the UK.</li>
      <li><strong>1976: </strong>Bowie stars in the sci-fi film The Man Who Fell to Earth, playing an alien who journeys to Earth to save his extraterrestrial home planet. Loosely based on his role, Bowie debuts a new personality The White Duke, coinciding with the release of his album Station to Station.</li>
      <li><strong>1977-1979: </strong>Bowie releases the acclaimed "Berlin trilogy" of albums, recorded during his time in Germany: the Krautrock-influenced Low and Heroes (both released in 1977) and the more pop-oriented Lodger (1979).</li>
      <li><strong>1984: </strong>Bowie gets his first Grammy, winning the Best Short Form Music Video category for his 20-minute film Jazzin' for Blue Jean, made to promote the single Blue Jean from his Tonight album.</li>
      <li><strong>1996: </strong>Bowie is inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</li>
      <li><strong>2006: </strong>Bowie is honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.</li>
      <li><strong>2013: </strong>On his 66th birthday, Bowie announces the release of The Next Day, his first studio album in a decade.</li>
      <li><strong>2016: </strong>Three years later, on his 69th birthday, Bowie releases his 25th and final studio album, Blackstar.</li>
      <li><strong>2016: </strong>Bowie dies at the age of 69, after a battle with cancer kept secret from the public.
